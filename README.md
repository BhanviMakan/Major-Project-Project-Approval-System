# Major-Project-Project-Approval-System
A Project Approval System is solution to the one of the major problem of institute ,
Universities and for various colleges also. The aim of my project is to solve the 
management problem of various major and minor projects submitted by students to the 
College faculty. This is contributed by me (Bhanvi) in the guidance of my teachers  
and training Professor 



Problem Statement
Academic Project management is a major issue which is faced by many educational institutes, 
the main reason for this is there is no automated system followed in any institute. College 
management/staff gathers all the project reports and project sources from students and store
them physically in some locations probably libraries. To overcome this practical problem and
also to make the process easy I developed a secure intranet application which is useful for each.


solution
To overcome this practical problem and also to make the process easy I developed a secure 
intranet application which is useful for each. It will allow students to submit their projects 
online and will be ease for teachers also to briefly check each student’s project and can 
allot them marks according to particular student’s efforts.
